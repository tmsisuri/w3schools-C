    //int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
    //float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
    //char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Characters are surrounded by single quotes

    //To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value
